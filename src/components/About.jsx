            Hi, I'm Guy Middleton, a junior software developer based in
            Manchester, UK.
            <br /> <br />
            I recently completed a 13-week full-time intensive bootcamp in
            JavaScript software development at Northcoders, where I gained
            hands-on experience in full-stack development. <br />
            <br /> I enjoy the process of learning and tackling complex
            problems, always seeking opportunities to improve my skills. I'm
            eager to take on new challenges and continue growing as a developer.
            <br /> <br />
            I also have a background in music production and composition. A
            dedicated website for that side of my work is coming soonâ€”stay
            tuned!
            <br /> <br />
            Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
