                  Safe Space Parking is a mobile application built with React
                  Native, TypeScript, and styled using Tamagui to deliver a
                  fast, modern, and accessible user experience. The app helps
                  users locate safe, secure, and inclusive parking spaces in

                  seamless sign-in options, and Firebase Hosting to support
                  scalable infrastructure and fast performance.
